__Coffee__ is the most important traded commodities next to petroleum and also consumed as a beverage by one third of the 
world’s population. Now day’s coffee uses as an input in some food processing industries, for instance 
it is used as flavoring to various pastries, ice-creams, chocolate, candies.
The genus Coffea consists of over 125 species in the world. Among all these species only the three species 
of Coffea are economically important such as __Arabica L. (Arabica coffee)__ presently accounting for about 60% of world 
trade; __C. Canephora (Robusta coffee)__, accounting for most of the rest of the trade and __C. Liberica (Liberian coffee)__ 
contributing less than one percent (1%).

__Coffee__ is the majorly traded commodity used by one–third of the world’s population as a beverage and 
Ethiopia is the home land of coffee arabica, it covers 7-10 % of the world’s coffee production.
This research work, focuses on the four major types of coffee leaf diseases that reduces coffee production in Ethiopia ,these are __brown eye 
spot (BES)__,__coffee berry disease (CBD)__,__coffee leaf rust (CLR)__and __coffee wilt disease (CWD)__.In this paper ,we proposed 
Ethiopian coffee leaf diseases identification using deep learning features. The images of the coffee leaf diseases were 
captured from the regions of Ethiopia where more coffee is produced, i.e. Jimma and Zegie. We compared gaussian 
filtering, median filtering and the hybrid of the two filtering techniques to remove noises from coffee leaf images and 
we have got better result from the hybrid of the two filtering techniques. And also we applied KMeans clustering for 
segmentation and CNN for feature extraction. Finally, we made a comparison between CNN-Softmax classifier and 
CNN-SVM classifier .The experimental results showed that SVM performs better than softmax classifier in terms of 
performance and computational time.
we have also used a field Rover to handle image capturing (This is done by employing IoT device like Arduino uno).
